            <p class="bali_text">Bali, the famed Island of the Gods
            , with its varied landscape of hills
             and mountains, rugged coastlines and
            sandy beaches, lush rice terraces,
            and volcanic hillsides all providing
             a picturesque backdrop to its colorful,
            deeply spiritual, and unique culture
            stakes a serious claim to be paradise
            on earth. With world-class surfing and 
            diving, a large number of cultural,
            historical, and archaeological 
            attractions, and an enormous range
            of accommodations, this is one of
            the world's most popular island 
            destinations and one which consistently
            wins travel awards. </p>

             <!--Maldivi-->
            <div class="maldivi_div">
                <img class="maldivi_photo" src="photos/maldivi.webp" alt="">
                <p class="maldivi_text">The Maldives are an archipelago of 1,192 coral islands formed of 26 atolls,
                    or atholhu in Dhivehi — the source of the English word. These are not single 
                    islands, but giant ringlike coral formations hundreds of kilometres wide that
                    have fragmented into countless islands.
                    Atoll naming is complex, as the atolls have both lengthy
                    traditional Dhivehi names like Maalhosmadulu Dhekunuburi,
                    and snappy code names like Baa that refers to administrative
                    regions and may consist of more than one geographical atoll.
                    The code names are the letters of Dhivehi alphabet, but being
                     easier for non-Maldivians to remember and pronounce, the code
                    names are popular in the travel industry and are hence also
                    used here.</p>

                city and almost 12 million people living in
                the whole metropolitan area. Located in the
                north of France on the river Seine, Paris
                has the well-deserved reputation of being
                the most beautiful and romantic of all 
                cities, brimming with historic associations
                and remaining vastly influential in the 
                realms of culture, art, fashion, food,
                and design. Dubbed the City of Light
                the Cidy of love (la Ville Lumière)
                and Capital of Fashion, it is home 
                to the world's finest and most luxurious
                fashion designers and fun cosmetics, such

                Dubai (دبي) is one of the seven emirates that
                make up the United Arab Emirates. With a shape
                like a slanted rectangle, it's bounded in the
                north by Sharjah and in the south by Abu Dhabi.
                The city is rather like an independent city-state
                and is the most modern and progressive emirate
                in the UAE, developing at a rapid pace, 
                especially in the tourist and trade sectors.

                especially if trying to take a train
